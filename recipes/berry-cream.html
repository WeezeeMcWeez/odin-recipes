    <h3>Making Fruit Tolerable</h3>
      <p>One of the most overrated food groups in the world are fruits, and specifically,
         "berries". Strawberries are trash. The texture of a blackberry is akin to that of
          a cockroach. But at least they aren't a <em>hairy</em> fruit like the raspberry!
           And don't get me started on blueberries, those sour excuses for treats.</p>
      <p>That's where Ruth's Chris saved me one day. If you smash a bunch of egg yolks and
         sugar and cream together--you get something pretty tasty! So with that--here ya go!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons of sugar</li>
          <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Complete next steps while water heats up.</li>
          <li>Separate egg yolks from whites and put into a large bowl.</li>
          <li>Mix egg yolks with half the sugar; mix the other half of the sugar with heavy cream</li>
          <li>Heat cream/sugar mixture until boiling</li>
          <li>Slowly add cream/sugar mixture to egg yolk/sugar mixture while stirring</li>
          <li>Now that all ingredients are mixed-use the pot of (now-boiling) water as a double boiler 
            to heat the mixture while you mix continuously. Should take 10-15 minutes or until the mixture
             has thickened to custard-like consistency.</li>
        </ol>
