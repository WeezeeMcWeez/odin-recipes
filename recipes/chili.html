    <h3>Average Chili But I Like It So Keep Your Mouth Shut</h3>
      <p>When it's cold out and I want something that's pretty darn filling without a ton of Calories, but will also
         <strong><em>definitely give me heartburn</em></strong>, I like to make this chili. To be clear: it is not special. 
         Well, it could be if you season it right, but that will be up to you. The ingredients are simple, and so is 
         the recipe.</p>
      <p>Let's get to it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
          <li>1 can Campbell's tomato soup</li>
          <li>1 can of Hunt's tomato sauce (usually about 14 ounces)</li>
          <li>Chili powder</li>
          <li>Garlic Powder</li>
          <li>Onion powder</li>
          <li>Garlic Salt</li>
          <li>Cumin</li>
          <li>Onion and green pepper</li>
          <li>1 can of red kidney beans</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Brown the meat.</li>
          <li>Rinse them kidney beans</li>
          <li>Combine tomato soup, two additional tomato-soup-cans of water, and tomato sauce to a boil.</li>
          <li>Combine meat and beans and turn heat down medium-high.</li>
          <li>Once chili has reached desired thickness, season to taste (usually quite a bit of chili powder)</li>
          <li>Add chopped onions and peppers and continue to heat for ten minutes.</li>
          <li>Add <a href="https://youngsdairy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young's Jersey Dairy</a> cheese curds for extra delicious-ness.</li>
        </ol>
