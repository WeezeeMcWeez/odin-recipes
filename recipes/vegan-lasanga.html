    <h3>Surprisingly Tasty Vegan Lasanga</h3>
      <p>When I get into "health mode", meat (which is something I already don't eat much of) is the first thing thrown 
        from my diet. During my first vegan experiment I created a vegggie lasagna, basically substituting mashed
         potatoes and black beans for meat (I'm allergic to soy, so tofu isn't an option). Ya know, it wasn't too bad!</p>
      <p>Now that meal has become somewhat of a staple at our dinner table four to six times a year. Try it out, homes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
          <li>Ragu pasta sauce</li>
